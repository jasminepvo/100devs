### Day 1: July 15, 2022

##### Todays's Progress

• Started and finished Class 01 lecture on YouTube  
• Start Class 01 homework - Coursera course "Learning How To Learn"  
 - https://coursera.org/share/ace875e4dd605145d75886055799dee7

 Mon-Fri 11AM-7PM with the pomodoro method and 1hr for lunch break  
 Sat-Sun Watch at least 1 class  
• Connected with folks on Discord - joined the mid July thread in #catchupcrew

##### Thoughts

• As soon as I watched the first video, my mind went "this is exactly what I need and have been looking for". Leon brought so much energy and feeling his passion, energized mine! I know I'm not going to be bored and I genuinely like him as a person and feel thrilled to have him as a teacher.

• I love that one of the first hw is "Learning how to learn"... it shows he's thought of everything especially starting at the basics and building a strong foundation. He emphasizes active recall and using ANKI (web note cards that are designed to focus on your most difficult to learn topics to fully master level based on an algorithm) which again, I love and agree with.

• I have completed the Responsive Web Design certificate form freeCodeCamp and foundations of The Odin Project so I feel like I have a strong hold on markup languages HTML& CSS and the basics of JavaScript. Previous discord messages say you can skip to the 9hr "Frontend Crash Course" and just review what you need to. However, I know I have nothing to lose by revisiting them especially when Leon explains the concepts in such an easy way to grasp.

"This is a marathon, not a sprint."

### Day 2: July 18, 2022

##### Todays's Progress

• Started and finished Class 02 lecture on YouTube

- followed along the brownies.html lab
  • Finished Class 01 homework - Coursera course "Learning How To Learn"  
   - https://coursera.org/share/ace875e4dd605145d75886055799dee7

##### Thoughts

• I found the Coursera course far more interesting than I originally thought. It taught me literally how to learn/take tests and the science behind the brain's thought process. HIGHLY RECOMMEND 10/10  
 - focus mode (high concentration) and diffuse mode (moving your body allows the brain to wander and make connections to what you learned in focus mode) are both VITAL in learning... this is where the pomodoro method comes in  
 - active recall, over a spaced out period of time leads to long term memory  
 - sleep is VERY IMPORTANT because it allows the brain to grow so reviewing before you sleep can be beneficial aka focus mode then diffuse mode when sleeping

• Class 2 was more of introductions and then a review of html for me. I was happy that I was able to complete the lab portion without any problem or confusion reaffirming my knowledge of html.
