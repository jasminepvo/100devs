### Day 1: July 15, 2022 - Friday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 01 lecture on YouTube<br>
‚Ä¢ Start Class 01 homework - [Coursera course "Learning How To Learn"](https://coursera.org/share/ace875e4dd605145d75886055799dee7)<br>
‚Ä¢ Set an action plan for completing the course<br>

- Mon-Fri 11AM-7PM with the pomodoro method and 1hr for lunch break<br>
- Sat-Sun Watch at least 1 class<br>

‚Ä¢ Connected with folks on Discord - joined the mid July thread in #catchupcrew<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ As soon as I watched the first video, my mind went "this is exactly what I need and have been looking for". Leon brought so much energy and feeling his passion, energized mine! I know I'm not going to be bored and I genuinely like him as a person and feel thrilled to have him as a teacher.<br>

‚Ä¢ I love that one of the first hw is "Learning how to learn"... it shows he's thought of everything especially starting at the basics and building a strong foundation. He emphasizes active recall and using ANKI (web note cards that are designed to focus on your most difficult to learn topics to fully master level based on an algorithm) which again, I love and agree with.<br>

‚Ä¢ I have completed the Responsive Web Design certificate form freeCodeCamp and foundations of The Odin Project so I feel like I have a strong hold on markup languages HTML& CSS and the basics of JavaScript. Previous discord messages say you can skip to the 9hr "Frontend Crash Course" and just review what you need to. However, I know I have nothing to lose by revisiting them especially when Leon explains the concepts in such an easy way to grasp.<br>

"This is a marathon, not a sprint."<br>

### Day 2: July 18, 2022 - Monday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 02 lecture on YouTube<br> - followed along the brownies.html lab<br>
‚Ä¢ Finished Class 01 homework - [Coursera course "Learning How To Learn"](https://coursera.org/share/ace875e4dd605145d75886055799dee7)<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ I found the Coursera course far more interesting than I originally thought. It taught me literally how to learn/take tests and the science behind the brain's thought process. HIGHLY RECOMMEND 10/10<br>

- focus mode (high concentration) and diffuse mode (moving your body allows the brain to wander and make connections to what you learned in focus mode) are both VITAL in learning... this is where the pomodoro method comes in<br>
- active recall, over a spaced out period of time leads to long term memory<br>
- sleep is VERY IMPORTANT because it allows the brain to grow so reviewing before you sleep can be beneficial aka focus mode then diffuse mode when sleeping<br>

‚Ä¢ Class 2 was more of introductions and then a review of html for me. I was happy that I was able to complete the lab portion without any problem or confusion reaffirming my knowledge of html.<br>

### Day 3: July 19, 2022 - Tuesday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 03 lecture on YouTube<br>
‚Ä¢ Completed Class 02 homework - [bcc.html](./class02-materials/bbc.html) ‚úîÔ∏è<br>
‚Ä¢ Completed Class 03 homework - HTML layout for [Tech Crunch](./class-03-materials/tech-crunch.html) and [Khan Academy](./class-03-materials/khan-academy.html) ‚úîÔ∏è<br>
‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 04 lecture on YouTube<br>
‚Ä¢ Started Class 04 homework - [Simple Site Lab](./class04-materials/simple-site-lab/simple-site.html)<br>
‚Ä¢ Took the five minute [typingtest.com](www.typingtest.com) and got 64wpm<br>
‚Ä¢ Practiced typing with [www.keybr.com](www.keybr.com) and got 82 wpm, stuck on q character<br>
‚Ä¢ Read [learnlayout.com](www.learnlayout.com)<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ Class 3 dove a lot into structuring HTML and assigning semantic tags. Learned that we should try to use semantically correct tags over div. The labs were super easy for me to complete!<br>

‚Ä¢ Class 4 touched on CSS and learnlayouts was a good website to cover the basics of the box model and common layout elements. I just started doing ANKI and just by making the cards, I can feel myself retaining the knowledge. <br>

- rules of Cascade, specificity and relationships<br>

‚Ä¢ REALLY enjoyed the video assigned to watch before class and added to my [Youtube motivation playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxQMbVxcoynL5lkksJY8l3FS4yL8jWMAi)<br>

- "In order to be successful, you have to want it as much as you want to breathe."<br>
- "The pain you feel today is a strength you'll feel tomorrow."<br>

"Go deep, not wide." - go deep with material and not spreading yourself too thin/wide. <br>

P.S. ‚úîÔ∏è are for homeworks that needed to be turned in on either [codepen](www.codepen.com/jasminepvo) or [glitch](glitch.com/jasminepvo)

### Day 4: July 20, 2022 - Wednesday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 05 lecture on YouTube<br>
‚Ä¢ Took ANKI notes during lecture<br>
‚Ä¢ Completed Class 05 lab - [15 Minutes of Pain](./class05-materials/15-min-of-pain-layout/index.html)<br>

‚Ä¢ Completed Class 05 homework - [Layout 3](./class05-materials/three-layouts/layout-3/index.html) ‚úîÔ∏è<br>
‚Ä¢ Started Class 06 lecture on YouTube<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ Navy Seals Video in my [Youtube motivation playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxQMbVxcoynL5lkksJY8l3FS4yL8jWMAi)<br>

- "If you want to change the world, don't back down from the sharks."<br>

‚Ä¢ HACKS FOR MAC<br>

- Digital color meter is built in to grab colors for design<br>
- Countdown is built in and useful for Pomodoro method<br>
- To comment: select text then command + / (command + forward slash) <br>

‚Ä¢ Class 5 - vomit code for now and refactor later aka clean up the code, put it in a bag and throw it away. Note: don't watch this lecture while eating, that gif of the chunky milk was horrendous. Other than that, I'm enjoying the active recall by still reviewing topics from Class 1. Everything feels drilled into my brain and I've been getting good sleep so cheers to memory consolidation. ü•Ç<br>

- reiterating rules of Cascade, specificity and relationships<br>
- floats, apparently more common in the industry<br>
- separate css folder for style.css sheets to address separation of concerns<br>
- sleepytime.com was mentioned to track your sleep

‚Ä¢ Hurray! I finished the css homeworks. My perfectionism kicked in while doing the Simple Site lab and I think it's pretty accurate other than making the border responsive with the background color. I have no idea on how to do that YET but I'm waiting to watch the responsive lecture. Three layouts using ONLY float was actually easier than I thought it would be. This display layout confused me on freeCodeCamp and TOP but Leon explained it so well that I'd like to say I'm pretty good with floats now üòé<br>

### Day 5: July,21 2022 - Thursday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Finished Class 06 lecture on YouTube and completed all in-class labs/pushed to Github<br>
‚Ä¢ Took ANKI notes during lecture<br>
‚Ä¢ Started Class 07 lecture on YouTube<br>
‚Ä¢ Completed Class 06 homework - 15 Min of Pain Responsive ‚úîÔ∏è<br>
‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 09 lecture on YouTube<br>

BONUS: Attend Startups Oasis Networking in ATL at ATDC @7PM ¬†ü§ùüèº<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ The motivational video for the day was by Eric Thomas again. I listened first thing when I woke up and the aggressive energy definitely got me going for the day. It felt like a push in the right direction so I enjoyed it.<br>

‚Ä¢ Class 06 reviewed HTML & CSS with 4 coding labs in class which I loved. Active learning is where I stay the most focused and retain the most information. I've been making web pages but didn't think to make a template file. Again, I love the cool little tips that add value to my coding. Touched on responsive websites which will be next class - so excited for this!<br>

- normalize.css -> default styling that is consistent upon every browser
- reset.css -> scorch the earth and get rid of everything single default that comes from the browser, start from scratch
- media queries -> give us the ability to display certain rules at certain screen sizes for responsiveness. Ex. this rule only applies when the screensize is between 0 and 600 pixels<br>

```
@media screen and (max-width: 600px)
  h1 {
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

‚Ä¢ Class 07 learned responsiveness to make content accessible across all devices. Continued on to networking portion which I took tons of notes over. Then had my networking meetup at night that went amazing! I got to meet so many cool, nice people in the startup world and learn about the Atlanta ecosystem. So much fun, honestly and makes me so excited!<br>

‚ùóÔ∏è Don't click apply to a job and stop.. network. make sure an eagle picks up your resume. find 3 individuals already in tech and have 2 coffee chats every week so when you finish, you'll have x connections (x = 3 * #ofweeks so.. 150=5*30)<br>
‚ùóÔ∏è Networking is making friends, say their name!! Stranger -> Acquaintance -> Friend -> Referral -> Coworker (The referral might get a bonus from the company and you might skip first round interview) WAYS TO FIND: Meetups.com, conferences, google interest + conference or #100devs-events (attend for free by volunteering!!! never eat alone, ask in discord), community groups (codeforamerica has different chapters, hackathons, womenwhocode chapter), apps like (Lunchclub or Bumble Bizz), talk to friends & family and tell them you're a software engineer. more on notion... <br>

### Day 6: July 22, 2022 - Friday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Video call to help another member understand floats and responsiveness<br>
‚Ä¢ Finished Class 07 lecture on YouTube<br>
‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 08 lecture on YouTube<br>
‚Ä¢ Started Class 08 homework - <br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ Felt awesome to be able to help Tosin and she said it clicks now! I love teaching and giving whatever I can (even though it's still early knowledge I can't wait to have more and be able to help more) to help others.<br>

‚Ä¢ Class 08 was tying everything we've done up to this point into making real website layouts. I like his baddie Tina emphasis on writing bad code for now. Just get it done! That's how you learn is by making mistakes, not trying to get it done perfectly the first time. Homework is hefty but.. I'M EXCITED TO START! <br>

- Dribble.com for designs

"Get rid of the fear. We're baddies and we write bad code. The sooner you give up on perfection. The sooner you embrace that and just try to write code of any shape size or form, your world changes. Free yourself. In the process of writing bad code, you'll find things to change or update but you have to start and you'll get better. Get here first and be Tina." <br>

‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 08 homework pt. 1 - [Layout Replica of TechCrunch](./techcrunch-layout-template/index.html)‚úîÔ∏è<br>
![](./techcrunch-layout-template/finsihedLayout.jpg)<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ Today did not involve lecture, just homework. I spent about 5 hours making this trying to perfect the spacing/overall css. I know I'm getting better thought because I didn't have to use any outside resources but man, it took awhile. Still enjoyed it though.<br>

---

### Day 8: July 24, 2022 - Sunday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Started Class 10 lecture on Youtube<br>
‚Ä¢ Started Class 08 homework pt. 2 - [Layout Replica of Khan Academy](./khanacademy-layout-template/index.html)<br>
‚Ä¢ Started Independence Day<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ Not much today since I was out with friends but still started on the layout for Khan Academy. The homework is taking longer than I anticipated since we're only allowed to use floats and styling is not my forte but I'm getting better. Fell asleep during the movie but I'll finish it tomorrow!<br>

### Day 9: July 25, 2022 - Monday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Finished Class 08 homework pt. 2 - [Layout Replica of Khan Academy](./khanacademy-layout-template/index.html)‚úîÔ∏è<br>
![](./khanacademy-layout-template/finishedLayout.jpg)<br>
‚Ä¢ Started Class 08 homework pt. 3 - [Layout Replica of BBC](./bbc-layout-template/index.html)<br>
‚Ä¢ Finished Independence Day<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ Layout 2 took 4 hours this time instead of 5 hahah, I'm making progress and learning quicker. Little hacks that made me happy..<br>

- CSS: line-height for spacing between lines<br>
- Shift Command (<> arrow key) to select entire line<br>
- Using custom fonts<br>

```
@font-face {
  src: url(./rondo/rondo.ttf);
  font-family: rondo;
}
```

### Day 10: July 26, 2022 - Tuesday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Went on an interview<br>
‚Ä¢ Completed Java vending machine assessment<br>
‚Ä¢ Finished Class 08 homework pt. 3 - [Layout Replica of BBC](./bbc-layout-template/index.html)‚úîÔ∏è<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ The interview was with a startup for financial bookkeeping software. Good experience and got to see a popular co-working space for tech startups called Atlanta Tech Village. Completed a take home assessment to build a vending machine in Java which consumed most of my time.<br>
‚Ä¢ Learned I don't need to be spending so much time trying to make the layouts pixel perfect. I am a perfectionist so being a baddie writing bad code is DIFFICULT for me. But I am learning to move on and come back later, slowly but still learning. Perfectionism is a hard habit to break.<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ Firstly, I am overjoyed that someone made a community for fit devs on Twitter. S/o to Kat. Fitness means so much to me and forever has a special place in my heart. Here's the commit I made:

```
{
  "name": "Jasmine Vo",
  "url": "https://github.com/jasminepvo",
  "image": "https://github.com/jasminepvo.png",
  "why": "To inspire and help those just starting their journey and also be inpsired by other members",
  "weekly": ["Gym 5x/week on my program", "Drink half a gallon of water/day", "Consume healthy and balanced diet with enough protein intake", "Sleep 6+ hrs/day", "Stretch between pomodoro breaks/day"],
  "goal": "To live an abundantly happy and healthy life",
  "location": "Atlanta, GA - USA"
}
```

Looking forward to making more contributions to this open source project!<br>
‚Ä¢ Ground layout only took me 3 hours this time! I am making progressive enhancement which makes me feel really good. Discovering new tips as well.

- fontawesome for icons, I copied and pasted the kit into my template üìß<br>
- Follow these steps to take a full-page screenshot:
  1. Open Chrome‚Äôs menu.<br>
  2. Head to More tools > Developer tools.<br>
  3. Click the three-dot icon from the top-right corner and select Run command. Also, you can press Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows or Command+Shift+P on Mac.<br>
  4. Type screenshot into the search box.<br>
  5. Select Capture full-size screenshot.<br>
  6. Once Chrome takes the screenshot, it should save it into your Downloads folder. Voila!<br>

‚Ä¢ AHHHH I FINISHED SOURCE LAYOUT IN UNDER 2 HOURS!!! I'm getting quicker i'm so proud and it actually looks decent or as my boyfriend would say it looks "professional". So happy!!!!<br>

### Day 12: July 28, 2022 - Thursday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Started and finished [Mayanwolfe Explains CSS Floats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjdsDxqt8vY)<br>
‚Ä¢ Started Class 10 homework - [Cuisine Restaurant](./restaurant-layout/index.html)<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ The floats video was super helpful even though I felt comfortable with floats already, it reaffirmed my knowledge and then added useful tips for images, headers and spacing! Glad someone reccomended it.

- Outline with wireframe layout before adding text/content. Also use these rules if you want your child section to be inherited in your parent section

```
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}

html,
body {
  height: 100%;
}
```

- Specify your sections with dimensions of height and width to avoid trouble

```
section{
  height: varies //example would be 50%;
  width: varies //example would be 100%;
}
```

- for images that overflow:

```
img{
  width: 100%;
}
### for the section the image is in ###
section{
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Continued Class 10 homework - [Cuisine Restaurant](./restaurant-layout/index.html)<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ Honestly was feeling a little burnt out from pushing so hard to finish these layouts. I took a rest day just as you would when working out. Still did 10 minutes to get a little bit in though.

### Day 14: July 30, 2022 - Saturday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Continued Class 10 homework - [Cuisine Restaurant](./restaurant-layout/index.html)<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ STILL working on the restaraunt layout. There are so many additional techniques being used to learn: text overlay on images, slideshow images, bottom border nav. Also had to dig for the original images. Spent WAY too much time on these things.

---

### Day 15: July 31, 2022 - Sunday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Finished Class 10 homework - [Cuisine Restaurant](./restaurant-layout/index.html)‚úîÔ∏è<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ FINALLY DONE!!! Putting this away for now. My brain definitely needed to go into diffuse mode so things could click instead of me staring at the screen for an hour wondering why it's not looking how I imagine it. For hair salon, I plan to work the wireframe without any content to get a good positioning on everything and make it easier for myself.

---

### Day 16: August 1, 2022 - Monday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 10 homework - [Hair Salon](./hair-salon-layout/index.html)‚úîÔ∏è<br>
‚Ä¢ Started [JavaScript Crash Course - Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c)<br>
‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 11 lecture on Youtube<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ Finished the wireframe for hair salon in 1 hour so I'm pretty happy about that! The wireframe and time away really helped things click and not overcomplicate it anymore. The lecture was a good review (and showed how much time would have been saved using flex instead of float) but I am sooo ready to move on to JavaScript tomorrow!!!

‚Ä¢ Listened to motivational video: [What will you do with it? - Eric Thomas](https://youtu.be/dV9worye5g0)<br>
‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 13 lecture on Youtube<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ I have missed the motivational videos so much, it was definitely what I needed. First class of JavaScript was great! Leon brought so much energy, it really got me pumped. I've gone over manipulating the DOM before but idk, the way he explains it.. things just click faster.

‚Ä¢ I LOVED Class 13! Especially the bachelor examples with toggling pictures with an event listener, I can definitely think of ways to use this. Huge bachelor fan also! The temperature converter was so cool and so simple the way he did it. Really feel like I'm getting a good understanding of manipulating the DOM.

- Good Pseudo Code = Good Code ü§ùüèº ALWAYS think through the steps in plain language before writing any code. Pseudo code gives us direction.

‚Ä¢ YOOOOO, at first I was super confused on how to add the li element in JavaScript and realized I am big braining and overanalyzing this too much. Added the li element in html, adjust the styling to css to fit the new li, then added my JS function and BOOM! I got it!! It clicked and I was able to redo it without peaking!!!

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ Went over a lot of functions today and I feel really good about them. This is where my knowledge of programming fundamentals is coming to play and knowing C++/Java has been super useful. They say you only need to learn one language and the programming fundamentals.. then learning another language is easy. THEY WERE RIGHT. Picking up on JavaScript incredibly fast so I'm REALLY happy!!!<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ I really like my header but it's been difficult figuring out a way to combine the two templates so I might have to forget about the header for now and get something up and running. Especially since I had a recruiter reach out with an amazing position where they are looking for 0-2yrs of experience, someone eager to learn which is exactly where I'm at. The call is on Friday, Aug 12 1PM with Kevel!<br>

‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 17 lecture - Networking<br>
‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 18 lecture - Project Night<br>
‚Ä¢ Started and finished Super Review Class on Youtube<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ The guests from out of town are gone so I will be back on my regular routine now and getting a lot more done. I haven't been able to code at my desk for 4 days and found myself dreaming about coding again LOL. Also making it a goal from today forward to be more active on Twitter just because the times I have been on, there's always such a GREAT Twitter space that I feel I get so much real value out of. The community is also so amazing - I mean strangers encouraging you, it always means a lot to me. I also think I'm at a place now where I feel really confident with my skills in calling myself a Software Engineer so thank you Leon. <br>

‚Ä¢ Super excited about my coffee chat today with Liv! It was so good to talk to her about the tech industry & traveling & her concept. We scheduled another call for Friday, Aug 12 at 2:30PM to talk about development and hoping to be able to contribute my skills to her amazing idea! I love meeting women in tech, so far all have so inspiring and empowering.<br>

‚Ä¢ I desperately NEED to get my hands on JavaScript again so I'm moving onto Class 16 lecture and will get back to my portfolio after. I feel like an oddball because I love the super nerdy side of building functions but also have a good eye for design in HTML/CSS.. it just takes me a LOT longer on the CSS aspect. I can't wait to learn a library or framework that will help speed up the process?? Maybe.. I hope its out there.<br>
