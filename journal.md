### Day 1: July 15, 2022 - Friday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 01 lecture on YouTube<br>
‚Ä¢ Start Class 01 homework - [Coursera course "Learning How To Learn"](https://coursera.org/share/ace875e4dd605145d75886055799dee7)<br>
‚Ä¢ Set an action plan for completing the course<br>

- Mon-Fri 11AM-7PM with the pomodoro method and 1hr for lunch break<br>
- Sat-Sun Watch at least 1 class<br>

‚Ä¢ Connected with folks on Discord - joined the mid July thread in #catchupcrew<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ As soon as I watched the first video, my mind went "this is exactly what I need and have been looking for". Leon brought so much energy and feeling his passion, energized mine! I know I'm not going to be bored and I genuinely like him as a person and feel thrilled to have him as a teacher.<br>

‚Ä¢ I love that one of the first hw is "Learning how to learn"... it shows he's thought of everything especially starting at the basics and building a strong foundation. He emphasizes active recall and using ANKI (web note cards that are designed to focus on your most difficult to learn topics to fully master level based on an algorithm) which again, I love and agree with.<br>

‚Ä¢ I have completed the Responsive Web Design certificate form freeCodeCamp and foundations of The Odin Project so I feel like I have a strong hold on markup languages HTML& CSS and the basics of JavaScript. Previous discord messages say you can skip to the 9hr "Frontend Crash Course" and just review what you need to. However, I know I have nothing to lose by revisiting them especially when Leon explains the concepts in such an easy way to grasp.<br>

### Day 2: July 18, 2022 - Monday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 02 lecture on YouTube<br> - followed along the brownies.html lab<br>
‚Ä¢ Finished Class 01 homework - [Coursera course "Learning How To Learn"](https://coursera.org/share/ace875e4dd605145d75886055799dee7)<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ I found the Coursera course far more interesting than I originally thought. It taught me literally how to learn/take tests and the science behind the brain's thought process. HIGHLY RECOMMEND 10/10<br>

- focus mode (high concentration) and diffuse mode (moving your body allows the brain to wander and make connections to what you learned in focus mode) are both VITAL in learning... this is where the pomodoro method comes in<br>
- active recall, over a spaced out period of time leads to long term memory<br>
- sleep is VERY IMPORTANT because it allows the brain to grow so reviewing before you sleep can be beneficial aka focus mode then diffuse mode when sleeping<br>

‚Ä¢ Class 2 was more of introductions and then a review of html for me. I was happy that I was able to complete the lab portion without any problem or confusion reaffirming my knowledge of html.<br>

### Day 3: July 19, 2022 - Tuesday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 03 lecture on YouTube<br>
‚Ä¢ Completed Class 02 homework - [bcc.html](./class02-materials/bbc.html) ‚úîÔ∏è<br>
‚Ä¢ Completed Class 03 homework - HTML layout for [Tech Crunch](./class-03-materials/tech-crunch.html) and [Khan Academy](./class-03-materials/khan-academy.html) ‚úîÔ∏è<br>
‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 04 lecture on YouTube<br>
‚Ä¢ Started Class 04 homework - [Simple Site Lab](./class04-materials/simple-site-lab/simple-site.html)<br>
‚Ä¢ Took the five minute [typingtest.com](www.typingtest.com) and got 64wpm<br>
‚Ä¢ Practiced typing with [www.keybr.com](www.keybr.com) and got 82 wpm, stuck on q character<br>
‚Ä¢ Read [learnlayout.com](www.learnlayout.com)<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ Class 3 dove a lot into structuring HTML and assigning semantic tags. Learned that we should try to use semantically correct tags over div. The labs were super easy for me to complete!<br>

‚Ä¢ Class 4 touched on CSS and learnlayouts was a good website to cover the basics of the box model and common layout elements. I just started doing ANKI and just by making the cards, I can feel myself retaining the knowledge. <br>

- rules of Cascade, specificity and relationships<br>

‚Ä¢ REALLY enjoyed the video assigned to watch before class and added to my [Youtube motivation playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxQMbVxcoynL5lkksJY8l3FS4yL8jWMAi)<br>

- "In order to be successful, you have to want it as much as you want to breathe."<br>
- "The pain you feel today is a strength you'll feel tomorrow."<br>

"Go deep, not wide." - go deep with material and not spreading yourself too thin/wide. <br>

P.S. ‚úîÔ∏è are for homeworks that needed to be turned in on either [codepen](www.codepen.com/jasminepvo) or [glitch](glitch.com/jasminepvo)

### Day 4: July 20, 2022 - Wednesday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 05 lecture on YouTube<br>
‚Ä¢ Took ANKI notes during lecture<br>
‚Ä¢ Completed Class 05 lab - [15 Minutes of Pain](./class05-materials/15-min-of-pain-layout/index.html)<br>
‚Ä¢ Completed Class 04 homework - [Simple Site Lab](./class04-materials/simple-site-lab/index.html) ‚úîÔ∏è<br>

‚Ä¢ Completed Class 05 homework - [Layout 3](./class05-materials/three-layouts/layout-3/index.html) ‚úîÔ∏è<br>
‚Ä¢ Started Class 06 lecture on YouTube<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ Navy Seals Video in my [Youtube motivation playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxQMbVxcoynL5lkksJY8l3FS4yL8jWMAi)<br>

- "If you want to change the world, don't back down from the sharks."<br>

‚Ä¢ HACKS FOR MAC<br>

- Digital color meter is built in to grab colors for design<br>
- Countdown is built in and useful for Pomodoro method<br>
- To comment: select text then command + / (command + forward slash) <br>

‚Ä¢ Class 5 - vomit code for now and refactor later aka clean up the code, put it in a bag and throw it away. Note: don't watch this lecture while eating, that gif of the chunky milk was horrendous. Other than that, I'm enjoying the active recall by still reviewing topics from Class 1. Everything feels drilled into my brain and I've been getting good sleep so cheers to memory consolidation. ü•Ç<br>

- reiterating rules of Cascade, specificity and relationships<br>
- floats, apparently more common in the industry<br>
- separate css folder for style.css sheets to address separation of concerns<br>
- sleepytime.com was mentioned to track your sleep

‚Ä¢ Hurray! I finished the css homeworks. My perfectionism kicked in while doing the Simple Site lab and I think it's pretty accurate other than making the border responsive with the background color. I have no idea on how to do that YET but I'm waiting to watch the responsive lecture. Three layouts using ONLY float was actually easier than I thought it would be. This display layout confused me on freeCodeCamp and TOP but Leon explained it so well that I'd like to say I'm pretty good with floats now üòé

### Day 5: July,21 2022 - Thursday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Finished Class 06 lecture on YouTube and completed all in-class labs/pushed to Github<br>
‚Ä¢ Took ANKI notes during lecture<br>
‚Ä¢ Started Class 07 lecture on YouTube<br>
‚Ä¢ Completed Class 06 homework - 15 Min of Pain Responsive ‚úîÔ∏è<br>
‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 09 lecture on YouTube<br>

BONUS: Attend Startups Oasis Networking in ATL at ATDC @7PM ¬†ü§ùüèº<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ The motivational video for the day was by Eric Thomas again. I listened first thing when I woke up and the aggressive energy definitely got me going for the day. It felt like a push in the right direction so I enjoyed it.<br>

‚Ä¢ Class 06 reviewed HTML & CSS with 4 coding labs in class which I loved. Active learning is where I stay the most focused and retain the most information. I've been making web pages but didn't think to make a template file. Again, I love the cool little tips that add value to my coding. Touched on responsive websites which will be next class - so excited for this!<br>

- normalize.css -> default styling that is consistent upon every browser
- reset.css -> scorch the earth and get rid of everything single default that comes from the browser, start from scratch
- media queries -> give us the ability to display certain rules at certain screen sizes for responsiveness. Ex. this rule only applies when the screensize is between 0 and 600 pixels<br>

```
@media screen and (max-width: 600px)
  h1 {
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

‚Ä¢ Class 07 learned responsiveness to make content accessible across all devices. Continued on to networking portion which I took tons of notes over. Then had my networking meetup at night that went amazing! I got to meet so many cool, nice people in the startup world and learn about the Atlanta ecosystem. So much fun, honestly and makes me so excited!<br>

‚ùóÔ∏è Don't click apply to a job and stop.. network. make sure an eagle picks up your resume. find 3 individuals already in tech and have 2 coffee chats every week so when you finish, you'll have x connections (x = 3 * #ofweeks so.. 150=5*30)<br>
‚ùóÔ∏è Networking is making friends, say their name!! Stranger -> Acquaintance -> Friend -> Referral -> Coworker (The referral might get a bonus from the company and you might skip first round interview) WAYS TO FIND: Meetups.com, conferences, google interest + conference or #100devs-events (attend for free by volunteering!!! never eat alone, ask in discord), community groups (codeforamerica has different chapters, hackathons, womenwhocode chapter), apps like (Lunchclub or Bumble Bizz), talk to friends & family and tell them you're a software engineer. more on notion... <br>

### Day 6: July 22, 2022 - Friday

#### Todays's Progress

‚Ä¢ Video call to help another member understand floats and responsiveness<br>
‚Ä¢ Finished Class 07 lecture on YouTube<br>
‚Ä¢ Started and finished Class 08 lecture on YouTube<br>
‚Ä¢ Started Class 08 homework - <br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ Felt awesome to be able to help Tosin and she said it clicks now! I love teaching and giving whatever I can (even though it's still early knowledge I can't wait to have more and be able to help more) to help others.<br>

‚Ä¢ Class 08 was tying everything we've done up to this point into making real website layouts. I like his baddie Tina emphasis on writing bad code for now. Just get it done! That's how you learn is by making mistakes, not trying to get it done perfectly the first time. Homework is hefty but.. I'M EXCITED TO START! <br>

- Dribble.com for designs

"Get rid of the fear. We're baddies and we write bad code. The sooner you give up on perfection. The sooner you embrace that and just try to write code of any shape size or form, your world changes. Free yourself. In the process of writing bad code, you'll find things to change or update but you have to start and you'll get better. Get here first and be Tina." <br>

![](./techcrunch-layout-template/finsihedLayout.jpg)<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ Today did not involve lecture, just homework. I spent about 5 hours making this trying to perfect the spacing/overall css. I know I'm getting better thought because I didn't have to use any outside resources but man, it took awhile. Still enjoyed it though.<br>

#### Thoughts

‚Ä¢ Not much today since I was out with friends but still started on the layout for Khan Academy. The homework is taking longer than I anticipated since we're only allowed to use floats and styling is not my forte but I'm getting better. Fell asleep during the movie but I'll finish it tomorrow!<br>
