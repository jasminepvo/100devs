# 100Devs with Leon Neol

Hi!👋🏼 I started 100Devs on July 15, 2022 and am SO EXCITED to be a part of Cohort 2. I want to track my journey for others who are interested in breaking into tech, learning new skills or just want to follow along! Most importantly, to hold myself accountable and be proud of myself for taking the time, effort and perserverance to dedicating myself to learning new tools and skills. At the end of this, I am confident I will be employed as a software engineer, making a difference in the world in a career that I love and am passionate about.

I am starting this 20 weeks into the live sessions so I made a [notion](https://snowy-astronaut-fd4.notion.site/100Devs-2022-Cohort-fb15c15f6684437a9bb8a6e638784a46) from a template thanks to the #catchupcrew. The community so far has been unbelievably amazing! 😊

🫵🏼 If you're interested in joining me in this free, online Software Engineering Bootcamp, check out [here](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/) for more details! I'll update this later on with my thoughts once I complete it but for now, you can check out my [journal](journal.md) where I'll log my thoughts and accomplishments of the day.

Happy coding! 👩🏻‍💻
